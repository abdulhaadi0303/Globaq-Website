                Successfully navigating third-party audits, certification audits, etc. can be challenging. While
                internal audits are often mandated to prepare organizations, ensuring true readiness requires
                expert insight.
            </p>
            <p>
                GLOBAQ consultancy services in Saudi Arabia specialize in preparing companies for ISO
                certification audits. Our experts, experienced in conducting third-party audits themselves,
                understand the critical areas that require attention. We conduct thorough gap analyses and
                pre-assessment audits to identify weaknesses and "grey areas" within your management
                system. We then guide you through the necessary corrective actions, ensuring a smooth
                external assessment and driving continual improvement. Because effective auditing requires
                specialized skills and knowledge of the standards, GLOBAQ expertise is invaluable.

                ongoing support even after the external audit to help you address any remaining gaps. We
                provide assistance programs for various management systems, including Quality, Environment,
                Occupational Health and Safety, Food Safety, Laboratory Quality Management System,
