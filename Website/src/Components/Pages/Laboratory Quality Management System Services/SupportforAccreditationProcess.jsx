                    GLOBAQ provides comprehensive accreditation assistance and support, coordinating directly
                    with the accreditation body throughout the entire process. This includes arranging assessment
                    audits, managing the closure of any nonconformities identified by the accreditation body, and
                    handling all communication regarding scheduling on-site external and surveillance assessment
                    visits. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We work closely with laboratory management to finalize visit dates with the assessors and
                    other relevant details. Our support extends to witnessing testing activities included in the assessment agenda,
                    resolving any offsite queries from the accreditation body concerning the agenda or document
                    adequacy, and evaluating the overall implementation status of the management system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    GLOBAQ ensures the laboratory is fully prepared for the final accreditation audit, maximizing
                    the likelihood of a successful outcome.
